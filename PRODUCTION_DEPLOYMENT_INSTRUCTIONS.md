## 🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT PROCESS

### **Step 1: Environment Configuration**

1. **Copy production environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   ```

2. **Configure ALL required variables** (no empty values allowed):
   - Core application secrets (JWT, encryption keys)
   - Production database and Redis URLs
   - Real payment processor keys (LIVE keys only)
   - KYC/AML provider production keys
   - Actual gaming license numbers
   - Geographic restrictions for licensed territories

3. **Validate configuration:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/production-deploy-final.ts
   ```

### **Step 2: Database Setup**

1. **Create production PostgreSQL database**
2. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
3. **Create admin user:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/create-admin.ts --email=admin@yourdomain.com --name="Admin Name" --password="SecurePassword123!" --role=ADMIN
   ```

### **Step 3: Compliance Validation**

The platform will automatically validate:
- ✅ Valid gaming licenses configured
- ✅ Production API keys (no test/demo keys)
- ✅ KYC/AML providers configured
- ✅ Geo-restrictions properly set
- ✅ Security requirements met
- ✅ RNG certification valid

**❌ DEPLOYMENT WILL FAIL if any requirement is missing**

### **Step 4: Production Build**

```bash
# Generate production build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run pm2:start

# Verify health
npm run health:check
```

### **Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification**

```bash
# Test compliance gating
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
# Should return operational status

# Test geo-blocking  
curl -H "CF-IPCountry: US" https://yourdomain.com/casino
# Should return 403 Forbidden

# Test license display
curl https://yourdomain.com/terms
# Should show real license verification links
```
